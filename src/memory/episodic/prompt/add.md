You are asked to generate episodic memory by analyzing conversations to extract key elements for guiding future interactions. Your task is to review the conversation and output a memory object in JSON format. Follow these guidelines:

1. Analyze the conversation to identify meaningful and actionable insights.
2. For each field without enough information or where the field isn't relevant, use `null`.
3. Be concise and ensure each string is clear and actionable.
4. Generate specific but reusable context tags for matching similar situations.
5. Your response should only have one json object.
